# AmazonFoodReview
Amazon food review is my first Natural Language Processing project. It predicts whether a product review is positive or not.

There are two parts, one is done by using scikit-learn library and the other one by BERT and PyTorch.

Using deep learning gave better results even though I had to use less data to run the neural network.
